# LinkedIn Policies Compliance

## Overview

This extension is designed to comply with LinkedIn's Terms of Service and usage policies. All text insertion is **user-initiated only**.

## Key Compliance Points

### 1. User-Initiated Actions Only

✅ **All text insertion requires explicit user action:**
- Users must click the "Insert" button for each suggestion
- No automatic insertion or auto-fill
- Users review and approve each draft before insertion

**Implementation:**
- `DraftButton.tsx` - All insertion happens via `onClick` handlers
- `insert()` function only called from button click events
- No automatic triggers or timers

### 2. No Automated Interactions

✅ **No automation of LinkedIn's interface:**
- No form auto-filling
- No automatic clicking
- No programmatic navigation
- Users manually click "Send" after reviewing inserted text

### 3. User Control

✅ **Users have full control:**
- Users can edit inserted text before sending
- Users can dismiss suggestions without inserting
- Users can close the panel at any time
- Users manually trigger LinkedIn's send action

### 4. Transparency

✅ **Clear user feedback:**
- Button states indicate when actions are in progress
- Error messages when composer is not found
- Users always know what text will be inserted

## Implementation Details

### Text Insertion Flow

1. User clicks "✨ Drafts" button → Panel opens
2. User reviews suggestions → Generated by backend or locally
3. User clicks "Insert" on a suggestion → Text inserted into composer
4. User reviews/edits text in LinkedIn composer
5. User clicks LinkedIn's "Send" button → Message sent

**No step happens automatically** - each requires user interaction.

### Code Verification

All insertion points are verified to be user-initiated:

```typescript
// ✅ User-initiated (button click)
<button onClick={() => insert(s.text)}>Insert</button>

// ❌ Would NOT be allowed (automatic)
useEffect(() => { insertText() }, []);
setTimeout(() => insertText(), 1000);
```

### Logging

All composer interactions are logged for debugging while maintaining privacy:
- Success/failure of composer detection
- Text insertion success/failure
- No sensitive data logged

## Best Practices

1. **Always require button clicks** - Never auto-insert
2. **Clear feedback** - Users should know what happened
3. **Error handling** - Gracefully handle failures
4. **Respect LinkedIn's UI** - Don't interfere with their interface
5. **User control** - Users can always cancel or edit
